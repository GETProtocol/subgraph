## Overview
This app is an explorer tool for interacting with your local Graph Node.
You can use it to test your subgraph with a visual tool by querying against it and plotting the data to a chart.
This uses Apollo as the GraphQL client, please see these docs for more information [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/)

Each chart by default is relative to one query, which you can then customize by extending the Chart class (TODO)

## Setting up a local Graph Node
Please see the README in the parent directory [Local Graph Node Setup](https://github.com/GETProtocol/subgraph/tree/master)
